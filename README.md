# Auto-GUI-Automation-Image-Recognition

Please note: this will probably not work on your machine.
This was built for my 1440p monitor.

I created a video on YouTube so you can see this in action: https://youtu.be/BjIi8EFppCo

I have been attempting to learn python and I have been stopping and working on things that excite me and things I really want to see done.
This was just a funny thing I peiced together just to see if I could.

Lines 6 - 12 in the PlayingAround.py code:
moves my cursor to Chrome window and maximizes the window the moves to the search bar and goes to facebook.

Lines 14 - 17
I use the image recongition built into pyautogui and I am showing it a photo of me from facebook.
I am asking it to find me and click which should open up the add comment window to start typing a facebook post.

Lines 20 - 22
We create a message to post.

Lines 25 - 34
Moves the mouse to the location of the GIF icon.
Clicks on the GIF Icon.
Then moves to the search bar and types in High Ground.
I am again feeding it a picture of Obiwan.
It takes quite a while like 8 seconds but then it chooses a photo.

Lines 37 - 41
Is moving the mouse cursor to post the text and the gif to facebook.

Lines 45 - 52
This is kind of a funny section I added.
Moves the mouse cursor back up to the URL area and types in a naughty website and then backspaces it out.
Then it types google and goes to the site.

Lines 55 - 61
This is the final bits of the code.
The mouse gets moved to the Google Search bar and Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem is typed and searched for.
The original code also used Image recongition and found Wolcen and clicked on it to bring you to the website.
However, this failed more times than it worked so I removed it and changed it to an x,y position instead.

That is pretty much it.
If you want to see the code in action please check out the YouTube video I linked above.
I found this really cool to do and it def. had a lot of trial and error to get it to work.
